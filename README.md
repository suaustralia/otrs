OTRS Soap Library

<div class="alert alert-warning warning">
This library has been replaced by <a href="https://github.com/suqld/otrs-rest-api">suqld/otrs-rest-api</a> and is no longer maintained. The new REST library (while hasn't had all functions implemented) is nicer to user, and the "right" way. This SOAP library is still using the old SOAP methods from OTRS, instead of the GenericInterface Webservices
